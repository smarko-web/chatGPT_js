## Overview
# ChatGPT AI App in JavaScript 

This self challenge was encouraged by this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FeymQoKvrk) where I learned the basic of nodejs, installing npm, using json, using API from openAI. I also discovered how to view the server using ```npm run server```(nodmon), along with viewing the client side using ```npm run dev```(vite) in the development stage. I was also able to understand the concept of *.gitignore* and *.env* to protect my private API_KEY.

## Continued development

I would like to become more proficient in my HTML, JS and CSS skills before I start doing more advanced web development. As I am practicing these skills, applying the prior knowledge that I have grained from YouTube and other Self paced courses, increasing confidence in web design/development.
